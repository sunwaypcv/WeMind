    ["The angle this photo was taken is towards the sky. It helps make me calm since I can imagine laying on the grass, looking and listening to the wind and trees swaying. It incites peace and tranquility. It is meaningful to me because we are often surrounded by concrete buildings; when was the last time you took a moment to admire the sky? I have learned that nature can calm us down, and for better health, we can surround ourselves with nature. #letusprotectmothernature #reduceplasticwaste"],

    ["Sometimes I just look at the sunset in the evening, and it is a very beautiful and calming sight of nature. It's ok to fall and fail, life still has to go on. Keep your chin up and keep moving forward, you will make it one day. Looking at the sunset makes me look at the bright side of everything in life, even something that seems to be bad can be good in other ways. Don't lose your smile just because one bad incident happened because there is light at the end of the tunnel. Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."],

Being in this place is special to me because I can feel the warmth and energy in the crowd as they gather with friends and loved ones while enjoying good music. Sometimes it is ok to feel burned out, remember to go out, have fun and relax, and don't be too hard on yourself. Learn to enjoy the little things in life, life is too short for us to worry. Just follow the flow and don’t think too much, enjoy the food and company like the one here."],
    ["The perpetual turning of the Ferris Wheel of life, encapsulates us in the eternal torture of repetition with the yearning of signs for metamorphosis. Scavenging for stimulants, yet being unconsciously desensitized towards it, morphing into a punishment by Dopamine. Though the emancipation brought forward by Endorphins is obvious, even trivial, who if any would like to embark on such a journey? One must imagine Sisyphus happy, One must imagine oneself, free. Though the ephemeral sunset, and so is our gratification and anguish, one must remember, of the good thing, that is scattered yet omnipresent."],

I have learned that life is not always straight and rosy but full of trials and challenges, and it is up to us to make the most out of it to become a better person and to learn from each experience. Don't be afraid to try new things because life gets boring when you stay within the limits of what you already know."],

    [`The lockdowns in 2020-21 were a tumultuous time full of uncertainty. On the bright side, I rediscovered drawing as a creative outlet and a way to avoid screen time; to this date, drawing still brings me much peace. Why a semicolon? A semicolon represents hope and continuation of life for those who are struggling with mental health. According to Project Semicolon, "a semicolon is used when an author could've chosen to end their sentence but chose not to. The author is you, and the sentence is your life." The flowers growing from the semicolon represent new life. (Another reason is that I enjoy drawing plants more than anything else.) This is a visual reminder that this, too, shall pass. Remember that you're not alone. Reach out to those you trust.`],

    [`Do you think we create our own destiny, or that it is already written & whatever is happening is merely happening according to script?`,`Even when we look back & can identify exactly when & what we chose which led us up to this point of time, is this autonomy merely an illusion?`,`Sometimes it may seem like a ‘damned if I do, damned if I don’t’ situation.`,`Kafkaesque - a term derived from the name of writer Franz Kafka.`,`Kafka’s work sought not to alleviate the soul through remedies of false hope or delusion, but rather, through the direct confrontation with the darker aspects of self. By distorting reality to map more accurately onto his own sense of human experience, he revealed a certain remedy of unhindered self-examination & carved out a place in the world for others to do the same. (Source) `,`What I like about his works is that despite it all, the protagonists never just lie down & give up. They still endeavour to overcome.`,  
    `Some critics argue that Kafka’s works are more joyful than they may appear - he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems.`,`When you come to accept that there is no problem - either everything is already pre-planned, or that problems are merely created…what else to do but enjoy & be happy!`],

    `Loneliness - you do what you have to do to survive & get through it. Sometimes one day at a time, sometimes one hour at a time, sometimes one minute at a time...a seemingly never-ending war against the jabberwockies in your mind.`,
    `You lose some people, you learn how to hold your own hand, you learn how to cry out to God & surrender to the powers that be.`,
    `In the end, you learn how to stand solid in your aloneness. There is a sense of peace in the chaos of nothingness. You learn how to take things in your stride. How to say no to what you don't want/need, yes to what you want/need. With the understanding that what you want & what you need may sometimes be two very different things.`,
    `There is a certain melancholy or the loss of this 'innocence' - the illusion of loneliness. After all, life's always better together, right?`,
    `Yet there is a tremendous sense of pride for emerging standing tall after having courageously strode through it all. An aloneness which no one can take away from you. Ever.`,

Memories of happy childhood days at the amusement park, when tiny chubby hands were held tight by Mummy & Daddy’s giant hands, & the sun’s rays lightly warmed the skin. The gentle hustle & bustle of young & old, the excited screams from the roller-coaster, the sereneness of the Ferris Wheel.`,

When this lady is sleeping, her mind starts flowing out like a peaceful`,`waterfall. The plant comes to life near the waterfall while some soil and rock look dry. The dry soil and rock represent our health. A full moon means we are going through the same cycle. We rest, do our thing, get tired and then rest."`],
    [`Depicting the magical creature, unicorn in abstract elements, the artist wants to portray the message that magic is all around us throughout our life journey - all it takes to see and experience this magic is our courage to believe, have faith and carry on. `,
    `Just like the magical and mystical creature unicorn, its existence started with the courage to believe, and its magical spirit lives on all around the world, within all ages, to those who believe. :) `,
    `When viewing upclose, there are tracks or traces of pathway that may or may not be covered with glitters on this canvas. That is akin to the pathway we take in our lives, and the various different experiences we encounter. Again, it takes courage, faith and action to carry on walking through those pathway in our lives. The experiences are for us to feel, see and live on - whether magical or not, that is up to us too.`],
    [`Butterfly Effect is also a symbol of transformation for the artist. There is this beauty of how when one thing or one person transforms, that will have a ripple effect to the surroundings too. `,
    `Back then in 2016, when the artist had the above concept in her mind, she found it amazing how energy works in such a way. Fast forward to the current time, the artist understands that is indeed how the Universe works - that everything around us is energy, and hence they bounce back and forth, affecting one another. `
    ,`This is one of the older paintings that the artist holds dear to her heart. It is now, time to share this with the world, so that its beautiful energy can be shared to others out there too, hence living by its name, spreading / creating that butterfly effect.`],

In the center of this artwork is a brain MRI of a person diagnosed with depression."`],
    [`“Individuals diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) often find themselves repetitively doing tasks, gestures, speaking or counting with an unjustified fear that stopping the action will cause something worse happening. OCD patients often describe their life as living with constant anxiety, a buzzing brain that just won’t stop.`,`In the center of this artwork is a brain MRI of a person with severe OCD.”`],
    [`“Schizophrenia patients often find it hard to differentiate between reality and what they perceive as real, leading to psychotic breakdowns, intrusive voices in their head and hallucinations that get them labeled and dismissed as just crazy. However, with modern science, it is now a condition that is treatable and manageable provided that the patient has a strong support system. In the center of this artwork is a brain MRI of a person with schizophrenia.”`],
    [`“The background of the painting - pink and black - represents outer purity and inner imperfection. White flowers symbolize modesty and elegance, while red flowers symbolize respect, desire, passionate love and strength. The surroundings, especially pink and white Sakura, represent that life is short and beautiful. The group of small colorful flowers symbolizes the human’s emotions and feelings.”`],
